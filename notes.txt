Path to destktop entry for autostart
- /home/user/.config/autostart

This worked but i feel like this is not robust
look into this later, try to set up a permanant ip?
ssh user@10.0.0.153

Use tkinter and python to make a GUI
    - what do i need this to do
    - designate what slides to run
    - change slideshow settings

    - start slideshow
    - control pi power? (power off, reboot, etc)

need to check for python installation, make install script

use Plymouth to update the splash text during boot
probably should make it so you dont have to reboot after updating the slides
