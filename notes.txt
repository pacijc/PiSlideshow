Path to destktop entry for autostart
- /home/user/.config/autostart

This worked but i feel like this is not robust
look into this later, try to set up a permanant ip?
ssh user@10.0.0.153

new static ip: 192.168.2.1
change in file /etc/systemd/network/usb0.network

run to save:
    sudo ifup usb0
    sudo ifdown usb0
